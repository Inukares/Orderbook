### Depth Chart

Your task is to build an orderbook depth chart, like in the `depth-chart.png` mockup and on cryptowat.ch/markets/kraken/btc/usd. The requirements are as follows:

  - You don't use any libraries other than what is provided.

  - Build the chart using a `<canvas></canvas>` element.

  - The chart displays both sides of the orderbook.

  - Hovering the chart displays the current price value at that location on the chart.

  - Stroke is darker than the fill of the chart

  - Each side of the depth chart has it's own distinct color (red/green as in `depth-chart.png`).

  - The chart updates in realtime in response to orderbook changes.

Styling is totally up to you - you can make it look like our orderbook depth chart, or get creative and do your own thing. Just hit the above requirements and you're good to go! We'll review the code and get back to you.
